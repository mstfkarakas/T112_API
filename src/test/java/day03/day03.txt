C01_GetRequest
***  TC01: Print the Response that returns when we send a GET request
     to https://reqres.in/api/users/

C02_GetRequest
***  TC02: Send a GET request to https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/booking/10
     and verify:
     The status code is 200 ;
     The content type is application/json; Charset=utf-8
     The value of Header named Server is Cowboy
     The status line is HTTP/1.1 200 ok

C03_GetRequest
***  TC03:Send a GET request to https://reqres.in/api/users/2
     and verify:
     The status code is 200 ;
     The content type is application/json; Charset=utf-8
     The value of Header named Server is cloudflare
     The status line is HTTP/1.1 200 ok

     Note: We can test all headers via Assert.assertEqual and response.then().assertThat()
     but to test one by one like Assert.assertEquals(200,response.statusCode()); in the C02_GetRequest is not good approach
     We can test only informations of header both
